# Population-Prediction-System-and-Pattern-Ananlysis
This project aims to compare different models through RMSE and MAPE while making predictions for the population data.
This project work uses the dataset densityrank.csv and using the features provided in the dataset population prediction models are designed
The result obtained from the population prediction models through RMSE and MAPE is coompared while the models are tested on the test data
The best performing models according to the error calculation are further used for future population prediction and density rank prediction.
